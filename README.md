CryptoKet is made using the immense power of Solidity and Next.js. This project combines futuristic elements of Web3 blockchain development and the popular culture wave of non-fungible tokens (NFT).

This application includes creation, buying, selling and reselling of NFTs and user authentication through metamask wallet. Its theme can be switched to both dark and light mode.

Context api is used for state management and tailwind css is used for styling the application. Solidity is used to write smart contract and hardhat is used to test the smart contract.

Getting Started
This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.js.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

You can check out the Next.js GitHub repository - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

Deploy on Vercel
The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the Vercel Platform from the creators of Next.js.

Basic Sample Hardhat Project
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
